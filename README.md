# 🧮 Simple Calculator (C++)

A console-based calculator developed in C++ that performs basic arithmetic operations.  
This project demonstrates fundamental programming concepts such as functions, loops, switch-case statements, and input validation.  
It is beginner-friendly and ideal for learning the basics of C++.

## 🧩 Code Explanation

- The program displays a menu inside a loop.  
- The user selects an option (1–5).  
- The program reads two numbers.  
- Using a `switch` statement, it performs the chosen operation.  
- If the user selects **Exit**, the program stops.  
- If the user tries to divide by zero, an error message is shown.

## 🎯 Learning Outcomes

Through this project, the following concepts are practiced:

- Working with input/output in C++  
- Implementing loops (`while`)  
- Using `switch-case` for decision-making  
- Creating functions for cleaner code  
- Handling runtime errors (like division by zero)  
- Structuring a small C++ project  
- Compiling and running C++ programs
